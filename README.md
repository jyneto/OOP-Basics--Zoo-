<h1>OOP Animals</h1>
In this assignment we where challange to use inheritance in object-oriented programming. The task largely involves thinking about a structure for inheritence but also includes partially ipmlementing it in code. 

<h3> The task</h3>
Imagine that you are creating the foundation for a program that manages animals in a zoo.

There should be a base class named Animal.

The class should have at least five properties that all animals share.

The class should also have at least three methods that all animals share.

You need to create at least three different animals that inherit from the Animal class.

These animals should implement at least one new property each and at least one new method each.

These animals should also have default values for the properties, both those set in the class and those set in the base class.

All animals must have a method called makeSound() that prints the animal's sound to the console.

There should be a constructor that can be used to create new animals.

One of the animals you created above should then be divided into two new classes that inherit from that animal.

For example, you might have a dog, and then you can create Bulldog and Chihuahua. The result is inheritance at two levels.

These animal variants should also implement some unique property and some unique method or at least an override that makes them unique.

In your Main method, you should initialize several different animals and ensure they make their sounds so it is visible in the console that the animals have made noise.
